I’m Aaron Galipeau, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and technology enthusiast with a strong background in cybersecurity, software engineering, and finance. I hold a BS in Management Information Systems, an MS in Cybersecurity Engineering, and an MS in Computer Science. My focus is on creating innovative solutions and empowering others through accountability coaching.

Life doesn’t always deal the cards you want, but I take pride in thriving under challenging conditions. I’m passionate about building tools like a cross-platform golf tournament manager, a bowling team data analysis tool, and a crypto visualization and location web app. These projects combine technical expertise with user-centered design to solve real-world problems.
